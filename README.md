# metric-learning

This is an implementation of two supervised metric learning algorithms, namely Fisher's Linear Discriminant and Neighbourhood Component Analysis.

FLD: Here, a comparison of a supervised Dimensionality Reduction technique, FLD is done with an unsupervised one, PCA on the iris dataset. For further information look at the docx file in the FLD directory.

NCA: Here, a comparison of a supeprvised Dimensionality Reduction technique, NCA is done with an unsupervised one, PCA on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. For furhter information look at the docx file in the NCA directory.
